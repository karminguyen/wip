Hosted Issue Tracking
====================


Requirements
-----------

I need a solution for managing tasks/issues that a team is working on. The team is typically small,
no more than 5-10 developers. 

It should be possible to enter a number of attributes on each issue:

  * Issue ID
  * Status - New / Functional Design / Technical Design / Development / Unit test / System test / Acceptance test / Closed
  * Assigned to - a team member
  * Estimate (possible split into estimate for design and estimate for development and test)
  * Time spent per team member
  * Description


It should also be possible to do some reporting:

  * Summary of time spent per issue over a specifc period
  * Summary of time spent per team member over a specific period
